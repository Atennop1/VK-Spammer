# VK-Spammer
This is a spam bot for VK, which I made when was bored. The bot can spam music, photos, videos and geolocation

## How to run

You need to download the "VK-Spammer" folder, open the project in Visual Studio and paste the community token and ID instead of the inscriptions in the "Main" method into the "Main.cs" file. After all this, in the same Visual Studio, you need to run the project
<br>On the Internet you can find information on how to get a community token and its ID

## How to use

Invite the bot to the conversation and enter the command.
<br>For example: .spam 100 message

Where .spam is the command itself, 100 is the number of messages without spaces, and message is the message that the bot will spam. It can be of any length
