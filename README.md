# VK-Spammer
This is a spam bot for VK. To use it, you need to download the "Vk Spam bot" folder, run the project in Visual Studio and paste the community token and ID instead of the inscriptions in the "Main" method into the "Bot.cs" file. 
How to get a community token and ID? You can find this information on the Internet.

# Okay, what next?
You need to run the edited file, and then invite the bot to the VK group and enter the command. 

For example: .spam 100 message

Where .spam is the command itself, 100 is the number of messages without spaces, and message is the message that the bot will spam. It can be of any length.
